    Metadata Editing: Enables users to edit image metadata such as date, dimensions, and tags.
    Search Functionality: Allows users to search for images based on tags and other criteria.

How to Use

    Installation: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Download: Download the PicLib project files.
    Run: Execute the PicLib_Picture_Library.py file to launch the application.
    Interface: The application interface is divided into different sections:
        Top Row: Displays the name of the application.
        Main Screen: The central area where images and controls are displayed.
        Bottom Row: Contains buttons and information related to image selection and display options.

Dependencies

    Python 3.x
    PIL (Python Imaging Library)
    Kivy

Project Structure

    PicLib_Picture_Library.py: Main Python script containing the application logic.
    picLibClassesPART1.py: Contains class definitions for managing image collections and tags.

Usage Examples

    Import Collection: Use the "Open Loaded Collection" button to import an existing image collection.
    Image Management: Organize images by adding tags, editing metadata, or rotating images.
    Search: Utilize the search functionality to find images based on tags.
